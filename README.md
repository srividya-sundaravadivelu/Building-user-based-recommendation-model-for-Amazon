# Building-user-based-recommendation-model-for-Amazon
Recommendation Model: Some of the movies hadnâ€™t been watched and therefore, are not rated by the users. Netflix would like to take this as an opportunity and build a machine learning recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users. This example uses Matrix Factorization and SVD from Scikit Surprise package.
